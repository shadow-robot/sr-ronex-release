At Shadow, we welcome contribution from the community. If you think an important feature is missing, or find a bug, please [report an issue](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr-ronex/issues?state=open) and we'll do our best to fix it or implement it as soon as possible.

If you ever improve our software, fix an issue, or write something that's generally useful, please do submit a [pull request](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr-ronex/pulls). Even if the code is incomplete, it is always faster for us to add a feature that's already almost implemented!

*PS: If you don't know what an issue or a pull request is, this is [a good place to start](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing).*
